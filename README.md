# CaMeLz Maestro Custom

This repository is part of the `Neudesic Maestro Framework`, and contains the `custom` modifications and additions to
this framework specific to `CaMeLz`. It is meant to work with the `baseline` repository which contains generic
versions of all code and configuration.

***WIP**: This repository was recently renamed. It is in the
process of being refactored to adjust to this name change and will go through a period of instability while this is
happening. Towards that end, identifiers within this repo now start with the prefixes `IBMAZ_`, `ibmaz-` or `IbmAz`
where appropriate to other similar naming conventions. This will change to `NEUMAESTRO_`, `neumaestro-` or
`NeuMaestro` during this refactoring.*
