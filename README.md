# CaMeLz Azure Prototype Customizations

This repo will contain the CaMeLz-specific customizations to the more generic configuration, deployments and modules
contained in the tenncare-azure-prototype repo.

This design is currently a WIP, so I will update this README once I confirm if it can work in the way I hope it can.

## Getting Started

TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:

1. Installation process
2. Software dependencies
3. Latest releases
4. API references

## Build and Test

TODO: Describe and show how to build your code and run the tests.

## Contribute

TODO: Explain how other users and developers can contribute to make your code better.
