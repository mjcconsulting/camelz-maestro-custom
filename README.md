# CaMeLz Maestro Custom

This repository is part of the `Neudesic Maestro Framework`, and contains the `custom` modifications and additions to
this framework specific to `CaMeLz`. It is meant to work with the `baseline` repository which contains generic
versions of all code and configuration.

***WIP**: This repository was recently renamed. It is still under early development.*
